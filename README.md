# Smart_agri
The project is titled " Smart Agri " . This project aims at presenting a real time use case solution to crop production methods and better farming culture . It uses Machine learning based approach to predict the optimal configuration and Data Visualization tools and techniques to analyse and visualize real time data set. It provides a web interface to automate variousBig Data and Cloud technologies, using Speech Recognition and Face authentication using OpenCVand face recognition model.

The project includes :

-  Cloud Computing:- We make our own cloud with following services.
     - SAAS :- Software as a service to provide softwares on clients demand.
     - PAAS :- Platform as a service provides different execution environment like Python3 , java
     - CAAS :- Container as a service provides container shell to user.
     - StAAS :- Storage as a service provides storage space to user .

- Big Data :- To store and analyze the huge amount of data we used 
   - HDFS v1 , HDFS v2 and HDFS v3 cluster based on distributed storage.
   - Map reduced cluster to compute data based on distributed computing.
  - Spark data processing.
